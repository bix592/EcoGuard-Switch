# EcoGuard Switch

EcoGuard Switch, an Arduino-based system designed to enhance energy efficiency and safety. The device integrates a motion sensor, distance sensor, temperature sensor, and accelerometer to manage energy use and mitigate hazards. 
It conserves energy by automatically turning off low-power devices, such as light bulbs, when no presence is detected. The system also monitors power consumption by 
detecting temperature changes in a shunt resistor to raise awareness and, lastly, cuts off power during significant
seismic activity, specifically during a PEIS intensity 6 earthquake, detected by the
accelerometer, to prevent electrical hazards and enable safer emergency systems to take over.
